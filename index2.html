              LessOnline is an ingathering for the Rationalist blogger diaspora, 
              an opportunity to meet people you've only ever known by their LessWrong username or 
              pseudonymous Substack handle.<br/><br/>
              The goal is to bring together a "mostly-online subculture of people 
              trying to work together to figure out how to distinguish truth from 
              falsehood using insights from probability theory, cognitive science, and AI." [1] <br/><br/>
              The structure will be determined by you: We'll have a collaborative schedule for "unconference" sessions, 
              where attendees can sign up to run anything they want.<br/><br/>

        <div>
          <p></p>
          <p>
            Lighthaven is a space dedicated to hosting educational events and programs that help people think better and to improve humanity's long-term trajectory. 
          </p>
          <p>
            Past programs we hosted and were excited about have been the <a href="https://www.matsprogram.org/">MATS</a> program, which helps young researchers break into the field of AI Alignment and workshops run by the <a href="https://intelligence.org/">Machine Intelligence Research Institute</a> and the <a href="https://topos.institute/">Topos</a> institute on helping people better understand the long-term consequences of developing Artificial General Intelligence.
          </p>
          <p>
            Lighthaven is a project by Lightcone Infrastructure, which is dedicated to facilitating intellectual progress on humanity's most important questions.

        <h2 class="title">Pricing</h2>
        <div>
          <p>We determine pricing on a case-by-case basis, but a good approximation is:</p>
          <p>
            <b>Retreats, Conferences and Lodging:</b><br/>
            $100 - $250 per person per day.
          </p>
          <p>
            <b>Events:</b><br/>
            $25 - $75 per person.
          </p>
          <p>
            We offer some groups large discounts (including free) if we think a project seems particularly great to us. Please feel quite free to ask us about this.
          </p>
          <p>
            You can use your own caterer, but our default caterer offers meals from $20/meal to $50/meal that most visitors have found quite satisfying.
          </p>
          <p>
            We do engage in some price discrimination. If we think your best alternative to our venue would be much more expensive, we may charge more than our listed price. We try to find a fair price that splits the difference between our own costs and the value you get out of the space.
          </p>
          <p>
            We also provide more bespoke services (see below), though we generally charge more for this.
          </p>
          <p>
            Overall we try to be reasonable about pricing, and don't expect to make much profit on the space.

            Lighthaven felt rambly and wondrous and fun without being pretentious?  Felt like an incredibly-well-executed, 11-of-10 house party venue (laudatory) crossed with Disneyland.

            I am still learning about cool things and spaces in the venue that I missed (there was a robot sand table?)

            We had an incredible time at the Lighthaven last week - many of the participants remarked how beautiful and cozy the campus is, and the atmosphere was extremely conducive for creative thinking and problem solving. All the little details from having lots of post-it pads and markers to mini fridges and fluffy slippers show how much thought was put into designing the space. [...]</p>
            <p>We hope to be back at the Lighthaven again at our next event, if there are vacancies!

            Man, I really like the aesthetics. Other people seemed to also. 'Well appointed' is the phrase that keeps coming to mind for me. Lots of things I needed were nearby when I needed them. Having supplies in multiple areas is a good call and I think your supply list is pretty good.
          </p>
          <p>
            The layout was also good for movement, good for thought. The math and science decorations were great. Vibe: it felt like you were happy to have us there and happy to help. That’s a nice and unusual thing!
